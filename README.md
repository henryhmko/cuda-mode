# CUDA Mode
Learning CUDA. This repo includes all scratchwork from many resources.

#### The Why
I have a top-down approach when it comes to learning. I usually start with a broad goal and then narrow myself down to specific topics. These goals aren't necessarily something grand; I simply like thinking of possibilities that could be opened if I have something in my toolkit. And for this time around, **I want to train a smaller version of CLIP myself from scratch to dive into the engineering challenges when it comes to training large models.**

> *"Plus Iâ€™m steadily working on these essays on running, though nobody
in particular has asked me to. Just like a silent village blacksmith, tinkering away."* - from **What I Talk About When I Talk About Running** by Haruki Murakami
  
I'm limiting myself to around ~$10,000 in AWS compute(the max I can get one way or another without actually paying), so I have to optimize a lot of things on my own. I was first looking at OpenAI's Triton, but I was running into two problems: the lack of resources to learn as it's still fairly new and that I did not know what Triton improved over cuda. And seeing there's a cuda mode discord that just started off this year, I'm excited to jump on and learn with their help.
